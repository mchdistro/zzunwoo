Enchantment stat bonuses cap out per item equal to the Max Enchantment level + 1. For example, Protection gives +2% Armor, but each item with this enchantment can only give +12%, even if you somehow get a Protection VIII item. However, there is also a global cap of the item cap x3. If you equipped 4 Protection VI items, you would receive only +36% Armor."
