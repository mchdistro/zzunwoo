Dimension is full of lava and hard to navigate so its highly recommended to acquire some form of fire resistance. A Paraglider would be of great use here, as well. Dimension has some weird magnetic interference making some of the structures like Keeping Castle or Awful dungeon impossible to find with a structure compass. But some adventurers speculate that they can help one to ascend."
