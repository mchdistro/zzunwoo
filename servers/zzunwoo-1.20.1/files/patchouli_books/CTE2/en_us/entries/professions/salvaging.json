In order to use a Salvaging Station, you &lmust&r place a hopper above the station, and place your gear to be salvaged into the hopper. Salvaging in the Station can yield more results and experience than auto-salvaging."

They can also be used to craft other items. The rarity of the stone depends on the rarity of the gear salvaged.

&bYou can also salvage your gear via the Hub auto-salvaging feature, but you will earn less experience doing so.&r"
